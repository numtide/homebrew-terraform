# homebrew-terraform

**DEPRECATED**: The goal was to be able to install unpublished Terraform providers but it didn't work as expected as Homebrew doesn't allow to install in `~/.terraform.d`. Use https://github.com/numtide/generate-terraform-provider-shim instead.

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) formulas for different Terraform-related tooling.

## Usage

```ruby
brew tap numtide/terraform
brew install terraform-provider-linux # for example
```
